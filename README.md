# LLM-based Instructional Agent System

## Overview
This project implements an intelligent instructional agent system based on the ADDIE (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation) model, specifically designed for educational purposes in Human Factors and Ergonomics. The system utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide personalized and interactive learning experiences.

## Features
- **ADDIE Model Integration**: Systematic approach to instructional design
- **Real-time Feedback Analysis**: Continuous improvement through user feedback
- **Personalized Learning**: Adaptive content delivery based on user background
- **Interactive Conversations**: Natural language interaction for enhanced learning
